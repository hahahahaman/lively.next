# lively.next

This is the repository of the [lively.next project](https://lively-next.org).

## Requirements

*Please note* Currently the Lively server runs best on MacOS, Linux or
the Windows Linux subsystem. Getting it going on pure Windows is
possible but will require additional tweaks.

Make sure you have the following software installed.

1. node.js version 8 or later.
2. git

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository and run the `install.sh` script twice. This
   will install the necessary dependencies and sync the Lively
   Partsbin with lively-next.org. Please note that this process will
   take a few minutes and the script will fail the first time.
2. Run the `start.sh` script.
3. Lively will now be running on your local computer at
   [http://localhost:9011](http://localhost:9011).
